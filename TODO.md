# TODO

- [x] Write a broken test

- [x] Get an expanding list on the screen as a component

- [x] Refine to a single item per symbol

- [x] Add colors for value increase (green) and loss (red)

- [x] Add symbols for the above, likely up and down triangles

- [ ] Add a "flash" animation to a ticker that has just been updated (just a shadow flash, don't want to overwhelm)

## Bonus:

- [ ] Have an actual "ticker tape" running across the bottom with symbols as they
      come in, in a marquee
